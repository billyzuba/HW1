    <h1> Designer and Origins</h1>
        <p> The original innovator behind the inclusion of an air unit within a Nike shoe was aerospace engineer Frank Rudy, who pitched the idea to multiple shoe companies without success until Nike finally came along.</p>
        <p> The inclusion of air was a resounding success as the original Nike Tailwind fueled runners all over the country.     </p>
        <P> Although he did not invent the technology, credit for conceptualizing what we know as air max todya is still given to Tinker hatfield, who first suggested to expose the air unit in the midsole of the shoe.</P>
        <p> The original suggestion to show the air unit was not well-received within Nike and received significant pushback. Many thought it would negatively impact the structural strength/durability of the shoe</p>
        <p> In time though, the designers won out and the Air Max 1 was created and released in 1987.</p>

    <h2> Air Max Today</h2>
        <p> In present day, the Nike Air Max line still holds a status as a classic shoe wearable for most occasions. </p>
        <p> Despite this, performance technology has surpassed the air bag foundation so the air max line of shoes is mostly reserved for lifestyle wear at this point</p>
        <p> Nike, never one to miss on a new marketing opportunity, recognized this, and has begun tailoring their offerings to a more lifestyle purpose with the introduction of the air max 270</p>
        <p> Since pivoting to a lifestyle focus the air unit has gotten bigger and more exposed, but the cultural impact of the shoe line has remained with their popularity seemingly never higher</p>
