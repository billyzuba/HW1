<h2> What is Air Max?</h2>
    <p> As the name would lead you to believe, all air max shoes contain a translucent plastic pouch in the midsole containing pressurized air.</p>
    <p> While this technologically originated with the Air Max Tailwind, it would evenntually be made visible in the shoe, creating the cultural sneaker icon we know it to be today!</p>
