This project is to satisfy the requirements of KIEI 451 Week 1 Homework.

The idea was to create a website for buying classic Nike Air Max shoes.

Page 1 is the home page of the website, with a brief description of what it is

Page 2 is a history of the shoe itself, describing its significance and story

Page 3 is a marketplace page showing different models of the shoes and current pricing.
